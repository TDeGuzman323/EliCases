                <h4> About EliCases...</h4>
                <br>
                    <h5> Eli's Passion </h5>
                    <p>Wood - I love the stuff. I love the smell, the texture, the feel, the closeness to nature - every individual characteristic of every grain in every fiber of the wood, even the ones people throw off to the side and call “ugly”. The reality is, those planks of wood, were once a living organism that provided shelter, health, and tremendous beauty to our planet. Nature and its elements, like wood, holds a special place in my heart that just maybe, both you and I share.</p>
                    <p>The wood we use comes from tree farms grown specifically for the purpose of economical cultivation without disrupting the ecosystem. In a way, we are carrying on the legacy of those once living, breathing behemoths and our planet’s many uses of them.</p>
                <br>
                    <h5> Eli's Beginning </h5>
                    <p>How I founded Eli Cases, started with my love for wooden objects and a desire to be around nature as much as possible while living in one of the most famous supercities in the world, Los Angeles, California. After starting Eli Cases, I was able to once again feel, smell, and be around those elements of nature that I love so much like I did growing up in rural Kentucky and spending much of those early years playing in the woods.</p>
                    <p>This journey, creating and running Eli Cases, has been a rollercoaster of a ride. It has taken (and continues to take) a lot of risk, work, and faith to dive into head-first.  Eli Cases initially launched in 2015 on one of the well-known online marketplaces. It grew readily, I hired a team, and we surpassed our competitors of other wooden phone case companies by placing at the top of the online marketplace sales charts. We took great pride in customer service as the core of our mission to our customers and lead the niche market with thousands of sales a year. More importantly, 99.9% of all our customer reviews - of our cases and the shop - were 5 out of 5 stars.</p>
                <br>
                    <h5> Eli's Fall</h5>
                    <p>At the end of 2018, I regretfully allowed myself to take the easy road in order to sell more cases by engraving images from blockbuster movies. Thus, the online marketplace was able to terminate Eli Cases’ selling privileges in accordance with the intellectual property infringement rules established by the online marketplace. Unfortunately, since Eli Cases had grown so fast and it needed many hands to run smoothly; without another platform to sell from and with the drastic change in revenue, there was no time to save the company. With the hard lesson learned, I regretfully had to disband our team and take position in another industry.</p>
                <br>
                    <h5> Eli's Rise Again</h5>
                    <p>Life has a way to test our endurance, to see when we are knocked down – even sometimes by our own doing – whether we will remain down or pick ourselves up to rise again. I choose the latter. It has taken more than a year of rebuilding Eli Cases in the hopes to restore it to and beyond its former success. I have excitedly returned to the helm to sail this wooden ship to new heights.</p>
                <br>
                    <h5> Eli's Future</h5>
                    <p>Failures plant the seeds of future success. Those seeds have taught invaluable lessons for me and my company. As of writing this, I am currently the only individual running this operation – luckily, with a few volunteers to help in this endeavor. A smile runs across my face as I look down upon the engraving of a world map on the back of my rosewood phone case. It’s an older phone model with a similarly older Eli Cases phone case. It has aged gracefully. The years of being held and dropped, oils from the hand, and mishaps; the wood has lasted, the case itself has lasted, and has kept my phone safe all these years. What’s even more remarkable is the vibrance in color and its design are far more radiant now than it ever was before. I think to myself – “I am carrying on the legacy for this tree that once was.”</p>
